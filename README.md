# 🦊 Fuxbot

Absolutely not working. Well, there is nothing else to say. Fuxbot is my personal learn-to-code bot where everything started. The mission is clear: develop features which are spot on for my communities. Anything else is bonus.

# 🪄 Features

Some features are global and some are just for a specific community.

## 🤖 Automations

### 📢 AutoPublishing
> `/autopublish <add | remove | list>`

### 🙂 AutoReaction
> `/autoreact <add | remove | edit | list>`

### 🧵 AutoThreading
> `/autothread <add | remove | list>`

Currently, AutoThreading just has some basic functionality which you cannot edit. Once a channel is registered it will create a new thread after every message and will delete the thread if the message is deleted.
