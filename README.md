# 🦊 Fuxbot

Absolutely not working. Well, there is nothing else to say. Fuxbot is my personal learn-to-code bot where everything started. The mission was clear: develop features which are spot on for my communities, anything else is bonus. Times have changed and now the plan is to make a public ready bot which is manageable by admins in every community.
