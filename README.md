# 🦊 Fuxbot

Absolutely not working. Well, there is nothing else to say. Fuxbot is my personal learn-to-code bot where everything started. The mission was clear: develop features which are spot on for my communities, anything else is bonus. Things have changed and now the plan is to make a public ready bot which is manageable by admins in every community.

# 🪄 Features

Some features are global and some are just for a specific community.

## 🤖 Automations

### 🗑️ AutoDelete (unfinished)
> `/autodelete <add | remove | list>`

### 📢 AutoPublishing (unfinished)
> `/autopublish <add | remove | list>`

### 🙂 AutoReaction (unfinished)
> `/autoreact <add | remove | edit | list>`

### 🧵 AutoThreading (unfinished)
> `/autothread <add | remove | list>`

Currently, AutoThreading just has some basic functionality which you cannot edit. Once a channel is registered it will create a new thread after every message and will delete the thread if the message is deleted.
